## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)
Deploy to any static hosting service:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the folder to netlify.com/drop
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo or use CLI
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a GitHub repo and enable Pages
- **Firebase Hosting**: Use Firebase CLI to deploy

### Option 2: Traditional Web Server
Upload all files to your web server's public directory. Ensure:
- HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA features)
- Proper MIME types are set for `.json` and `.js` files
- Service worker is served from the root domain

### Option 3: Local Testing
For development and testing:
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd cinefilos-pwa

# Start a local server
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Or use Node.js
npx serve .

# Or use PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

## API Configuration
The app uses the OMDb API for movie data. The current API key is included for testing, but for production use:
1. Get your own API key from [omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
2. Replace the `apiKey` variable in the JavaScript code
3. Consider implementing server-side API calls for better security

## Customization
- **Colors**: Modify CSS custom properties in the `<style>` section
- **Movies**: Edit the `defaultEntries` array in JavaScript
- **Recommendations**: Update `popularMovieTitlesForRecommendations` array
- **Icons**: Replace icon files with your own designs

## Troubleshooting

### PWA Not Installing
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- Check that manifest.json is accessible
- Verify service worker is registering successfully
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Service Worker Issues
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure service-worker.js is in the root directory
- Verify MIME type is set correctly for .js files

### iOS Installation Issues
- Use Safari browser (not Chrome or other browsers)
- Ensure iOS 11.3 or later
- Check that all meta tags are present
- Verify icon files are accessible

## Performance Optimization
- Icons are cached for offline use
- Movie posters are cached dynamically
- API responses are cached with network-first strategy
- Static assets use cache-first strategy

## Security Considerations
- API key should be moved to server-side for production
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all external resources

## Support
For issues or questions about the PWA implementation, check:
- Browser developer console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- Application tab for service worker status
- Manifest tab for PWA installation criteria
